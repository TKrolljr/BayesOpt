IMPORTANT:
for a Tersoff calculation, the data file must be converted forst .. essentially stripped off its 3rd column (charges : needed when ReaxFF is used)

the "in file" is given as well.

The "essential" number is in the "out file" of out.Si3N4, or the "log file" of log.lammps
>> 0   -303.46972          0.1 

=> -303.46972



You see the parameter file => tersoff.SiCN.SiC-noCN.001-1.200214 ... actually quite messy 

eliminating the lines with C brings you to => tersoff.SiN.param 

#                m    gamma lambda3          c         d          h          n         beta  lambda2         B         R         D   lambda1         A
Si   N    N      3   1.0993       0   100390.0   16.2170   -0.59825    0.78734 1.100000e-06   2.1218   294.986    2.2731   0.15178    4.1254   4487.63
N    Si   Si     3   1.0993       0    79934.0  134.3200   -0.99734   12.44980 1.056200e-01   2.1218   294.986    2.2731   0.15178    4.1254   4487.63

As you see, the last 6 columns are identical in both lines. ... they MUST be identical ... (technical, they can differ, but then it's not a "Tersoff potential" anymore.

I would recomed to pick lambda1, lambda2, A, or B (or one after the other) as the parameter to be optimized.
Then just compute the "energy" of the structure ... without optimization  ... and define as "objective function" the squared difference between whatever value you get and "-303.46972" 


If this works, and works for each of the parameters lambda1, lambda2, A, or B independently (always optimizing just one) => great !

Next step will then strive for an optimization of two parameters, e.g. (A,B) or (lambda1, lambda2) simultaneously. This will require at least two more calculations to be added.
